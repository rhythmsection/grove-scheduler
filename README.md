Hello!

This is my solution to the Grove Scheduler application build technical challenge. It's built on a React/redux base. I included a sample test --- would have liked to have included more given a longer time frame.

This should satisfy the three requirements as listed:

1. Calls the endpoint to retrieve task data.
2. Displays the tasks, delineating which have happened in the previous three hours and which will happen in the next 24.
3. Uses the Web Notifications API (here in a React component) to inform the user about upcoming events.

In order to run this application, you should be able to follow these steps:

1. Git Clone from `git clone git@github.com:rhythmsection/grove-scheduler.git`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

Thanks for taking a look!
